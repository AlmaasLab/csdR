      abstract = "Differential co-expression network analysis has become an important tool to gain understanding of biological phenotypes and diseases. The CSD algorithm is a method to generate differential co-expression networks by comparing gene co-expressions from two different conditions. Each of the gene pairs is assigned conserved (C), specific (S) and differentiated (D) scores based on the co-expression of the gene pair between the two conditions. The result of the procedure is a network where the nodes are genes and the links are the gene pairs with the highest C-, S-, and D-scores. However, the existing CSD-implementations suffer from poor computational performance, difficult user procedures and lack of documentation.",
