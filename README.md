This repository implements the CSD algorithm presented by [Voigt et al. 2017](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005739) in an efficient manner in R.
* Requrirements: Requirements: R (version 3.5.0 or higher) with packages `WGCNA`, `optparse`, `glue`, `magrittr` and `Rcpp` (and of course a C++ compiler) installed. Additionally, having an optimized Blas library such as openBlas is highly recommended for performance reasons (see [this link](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2010/06/faster-r-through-better-blas/) for more info).
