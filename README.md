# csdR

This R-package implements the CSD algorithm presented by [Voigt et al. 2017](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005739) in an efficient manner.
* Requrirements: Requirements: R (version 4.1.0 or higher) with packages `WGCNA`, `optparse`, `glue`, `magrittr` and `Rcpp` (and of course a C++ compiler) installed. Additionally, having an optimized Blas library such as openBlas is highly recommended for performance reasons (see [this link](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2010/06/faster-r-through-better-blas/) for more info).

## Installation

In order to install the release version from Bioconductor, do type in the R terminal:

```
if(!requireNamespace("BiocManager")){
  install.packages("BiocManager")
}
BiocManager::install("phyloseq")
```

If you want to install the development version instead:

```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AlmaasLab/csdR", ref = "main")
```

## Usage
