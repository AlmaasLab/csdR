\title{Run bootstrapping of Spearman correlations within a dataset}
\usage{
run_cor_bootstrap(x, n_it = 20L, nThreads = 1L, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric matrix, the gene expression matrix to analyse.
Genes are in columns, samples are in rows.}

\item{n_it}{Integer, number of bootstrap iterations}

\item{nThreads}{Integer, number of threads to use for computations}

\item{verbose}{Logical, should progress be printed?}
}
\value{
A list with two fields \describe{
\item{rho}{Numeric matrix constaining the bootstrapped mean of the Spearman correlation between each column}
\item{var}{Numeric matrix constaining the bootstrapped variance of the Spearman correlation between each column}
}
}
\description{
This function provides the more low-level functionality
of bootstrapping the Spearman correlations of the columns within a dataset.
Only use this function if you want a low-level interface, else \code{\link{run_csd}}
provides a more streamlined approach if you want to do a CSD analysis.
}
\examples{
cor_res <- run_cor_bootstrap(x = normal_expression, n_it = 100, nThreads = 2L)
}
