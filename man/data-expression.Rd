\title{Sample expression matrices for CSD}
\format{
Numeric matrices of normalized gene expression.
Genes are in columns, whereas samples are in rows.
}
\source{
For the expression matrix for healthy individuals,
GenotypeTissue Expression (GTEx) V7.
For the thyroid cancer patients,
the data are obtained for the Thyroid Cancer
project (THCA) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

\description{
Sample expression matrices of thyroid gland tissue for
thyroid cancer patients and healthy individuals. These datasets
were pre-processed by Gulla et al. (2019).
Due to size requirements, only 1000 randomly selected genes
are provided in the dataset. Number of samples are 399 and 504
in the healthy controls and the sick samples, respectively.
